INTRODUCTION

BitCoin Backup provides an easy, fast, and secure way to backup your BitCoin
wallet to the BitCoin Backup cloud service. Using industry standard encryption
technology (AES256), BitCoin Backup makes sure that your data is safe while also 
making sure you'll never lose your BitCoins during a computer catastrophy.

BITCOIN BACKUP LICENSE

BitCoin Backup is open source software distributed under the terms of the MIT 
Public License. The software, however, might not qualify as 'free software' 
under certain definitions as it is written in a non-free language (RealBasic).

You are free to use, modify, and distribute this software in any way you see 
fit as long as you contribute any changes you make back to the community. It 
would also be nice if you send the author your changes too so I can merge the 
good stuff you're writing with the main project. The best way to do this is 
by using git.

WHY IS THIS THE ONLY FILE HERE?

Because the software isn't done yet or really do a place where there's any 
code worth committing. That will change over the next few days and this file 
wil reflect those changes.

HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHOR?

Pretty easily. Just email feeltherage@ymail.com. I also would be very 
greatful for any donations you might decide to provide to help me keep 
working on this project. I do not accept cash or Paypay. I only will 
accept BitCoins since, after all, this is a BitCoin related project :-)
